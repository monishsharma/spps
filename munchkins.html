                                    results.
                                    Methodology adopted by MUNCHKINS is based on research and scientific facts on how
                                    children learn and what they learn? This process of learning ensures that children
                                    develop conceptual understanding of various topics and how to apply these concepts
                                    across various subjects in their later school years. Hence, our focus is at
                                    providing the best-modern-comfortable amenities to our little ones.

                                    provides good transport facility. Pick up and drop facility is given to all
                                    students, ensuring complete safety. Though adequate care is taken for the safety of
                                    child, the school is not responsible for any accident, mishap or injury that may
                                    occur in or around the school premises or during travel.
                                    ‌Parents are requested to send a written note if a child is to be sent back with any
                                    other guardian not introduced to the school faculty before. Else we would not send

                                    As a matter of practice we advise parents not to send sick children to the school.
                                    ‌However, if the child is in recuperative mode and needs some follow up medicines,
                                    then the parents need to give the medicine along with a medicine approval form and
                                    the doctor's prescription and we can give it when the time is due. They should also
                                    get in touch with the child's class teacher.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    ‌If a child feels sick during the school hours, we immediately inform the parent and
                                    take the child to nearest available facility with due approval from the parents.
                                    ‌ School also organises periodical health check-ups for kids to get updated with
                                    their physical health.
