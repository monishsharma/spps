								<p>Manpower without Unity is not a strength unless it is harmonized and united properly, then it becomes a spiritual power."

								<p>Sardar patel public school is an edifice of faith. It is the crystallization of the dreams of our Founder, Late Ch. Ramsamujh Patel on the guiding lines of our eponym Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. With the belief that character building and personality development are the core aspects of all learning process, we aim at moulding the students into good citizens, making them responsible individuals and grooming them into complete adults fit to compete in the contemporary global world.  </p>

									Our constant endeavour has been to provide the best of facilities and amenities in education, so that when our students step out into the world, they are at par with the contemporary era and find their own path 'From Darkness to Light' as is envisioned in our motto. </p>

								<h3>Mrs Geeta Patel</h3>
								<p>A teacher can never truly teach unless he is still learning himself. A lamp can never light another lamp unless it continues to burn its own flame. The teacher who has come to the end of his subject, who has no living traffic with his knowledge but merely repeats his lesson to his students, can only load their minds, he cannot quicken them." - <strong>Swami Vivekanand 
								</strong></p>
								<p>When we mention education, it weaves a simple picture in our minds of a student learning and a teacher teaching, but education is beyond the classical paper-pencil board theory. It has evolved into the giant wheel that has many spokes such as personality management, time management, competing beyond boundaries etc. We, at SPPS, have strived hard to propagate our age old theory to impart quality education at affordable price to the able scholars who seek excellence in their pursuit for an indomitable career</p>
								
							</div>
							<div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-6 col-xs-12" style="margin-top: 20px;">
								<p>Offering an experience with a world class difference, we welcome all with open arms to enrich themselves with Indian values and modernity at the same time. 

									I congratulate Principal, Vice Principal and staff for their dedication to help the students traverse the greater heights of academic excellence and holistic growth. I wish the staff and the students the best in all their future endeavours.

								<h3>Mr Ashok Verma</h3>
								<p>When students graduate from school, their entry into the world should be so smooth; it  should be so impactful that it touches the lives of multitudes; and it should be so unique that it remains etched in the minds of those who revelled in it.
								This is the dream that we at, Sardar Patel Inter College and Sardar Patel Public School have for our students. We want to prepare them so that they can face challenges with aplomb and accept success with humility. . We want them to be known as honourable players and not just winners, as wise and not just intelligent, as kind and compassionate and not just friendly.</strong></p>
								<p>Along with mastery of the various areas of academics, we encourage our students to enjoy and excel in sports, extra curricular and co-curricular activities. They are guided to learn the art of governance by organising events and being  part of Student's Council as student leaders.  A very competent team of teachers strive to focus on each and every child, monitor and mentor them, appreciate their achievement and encourage them to overcome their shortcomings.Under the dynamic leadership of our Director Ch. Shailendra Patel, the school has been progressive in imbibing in its students value based education to produce a generation of well informed and emotionally sound generation. The school is immensely proud of its alumni who are successful, effective and impactful in variety of fields, and hence our reputation grows further. I am positive that in times to come we will continue this journey with elevated enthusiasm.</p>

								<h3>Mr K.P Sahu</h3>
								<p>It gives me immense joy to reiterate that Sardar Patel Group of Schools has its deep root in the field of education in the city of Kanpur. I feel proud and privileged to be the part of this magnificent institution. At this juncture, I gratefully acknowledge the yeomen service rendered by our visionary predecessors, management, dedicated teachers, ever supporting parents and students who have worked selflessly and tirelessly to bring glory to God and honour to the school.</p>
								<p>I am pleased to acknowledge that SPIC and SPPS lays its stress not just on academic excellence but on “character formation with academic excellence”. It motivates students to “always aim high” and cultivate core values as a first place for the divine, integrity of character and maturity in behaviour, pursuit of excellence and creative genius, respect of the human person with an emphasis for elders and teachers, loyalty to the nation and a balanced understanding of the prevailing global situation.</p>

								
							</div>
							<div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-6 col-xs-12" style="margin-top: 20px;">
								<p>I wish and pray that our students may imbibe in themselves the qualities of human values and become socially conscious, intellectually competent, culturally relevant, morally upright, religiously vibrant and emotionally balanced. Dear parents/guardians with your support together we can achieve the dream that you have for your wards. I can foresee that every child who has entered our temple of education with its motto “Tamso Ma Jyotirgamaya" will certainly reach the heights of glory.
								I am sure that your time here will be an exciting learning experience of a lifetime, leaving your imprint on your alma mater. Exciting times are ahead of us and I hope you too choose to be a part of our continuing success.
